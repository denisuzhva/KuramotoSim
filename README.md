# KuramotoSim

The Kuramoto model is able to describe a huge variety of examples of synchronization in the real world. We re-consider it through the framework of the network science and study the phenomenon of a particular interest, agent clustering. 
We propose a framework, which is able to describe clusterization in systems of intelligent agents given their outputs.
The current repository consists of simulation environments, which implement the framework and visualize dynamics of a system based on the local communication protocol and the topology of connections.
