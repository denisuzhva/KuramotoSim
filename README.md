# KuramotoSim

Multi-agent technologies give us a new way to study and control complex systems. 
Local interactions between agents often lead to their cluster synchronization, which usually is a more rapid process in comparison with relatively slow changes in external environment. 
Usually, the goal of control system theory is defined by its behaviour on long time intervals. 
When these time intervals are much longer than the time of cluster formation, clusters may be considered as new variables in a "slow" time model. 
Thus, it allows us to reduce significantly the dimensionality of a system by omitting considerations of each separated agent, so that we may hope to reduce the required amount of control inputs.
In this paper we develop a mathematical framework for analysis of cluster flows in multi-agent networks and use it to analyze the Kuramoto model as an interesting example of a complex system.
We propose an alternative approach to system control on a meso-scale level by applying a common control action to a whole cluster--instead of treating each agent separatedly (micro-scale) or controlling the whole system (macro-scale) using a control input common for all agents.
Clusterization leads to sparse representation of dynamic trajectories in the whole quantized state space.
With that in mind, compressive sensing allows to restore the trajectories in high-dimensional discrete state space based on significantly lower amount of randomized integral meso-observations.
The theoretical results, both regarding controlling clusters and compression, are demonstrated for a simulated multi-agent network with multiple clusters.
